1. Context
The Bhejane trading store is an online retailer specialising in Covid essesstial items. The store has recently been struggling with the management of its database-related inventory system.


Received a denormalised database consisting of two tables. The task was to transform the database such that it is in third normal form (3NF) using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) which is a guideline on what tables that need to be produced. Once we have normalised the database, we had to query the database to gain some insights from the database.
